            <h2>About Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to long-term alterations in Earth's climate patterns, predominantly characterized by shifts in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric conditions. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the planet to warm. This warming contributes to various environmental changes, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. Climate change poses significant challenges to global ecosystems, biodiversity, and human societies, making it a critical issue that requires collective efforts to mitigate its impacts and adapt to the changing conditions.</p>
